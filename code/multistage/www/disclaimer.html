  The portal relates to the publication: Gerstung et al., Personally tailored cancer management based on knowledge banks of genomic and clinical data (submitted manuscript). <br><br>
  It was developed on a cohort of 1,540 intensively treated patients with acute myeloid leukaemia, enrolled in three trials (AMLHD-98A, n=627;  AMLHD-98B, n=173; and AMLSG-07/04, n=740). 
  The median age of patients was 50 (40-57 inter quartile range, min 18, max 84). Median ECOG performance was 1 (0-2 inter quartile range). 
  A panel of 111 cancer genes was profiled in addition to cytogenetic data and diagnostic blood counts (Papaemmanuil et al., New England Journal of Medicine, in press). <br><br>
  Together these data were correlated with disease outcomes using a multistage model, where each individual transition was modelled as a regularised Cox proportional hazards model.
  The accuracy (concordance) of predictions for overall survival is C=0.72 (leave one out cross-validation), C=0.70 (avg. inter-trial cross validation) and C=0.70 (TCGA, n=176, external validation). 
  <br><br>
  The algorithm has not been prospectively validated and treatment options (haematopoietic stem cell transplants) were not randomised.<br><br>
